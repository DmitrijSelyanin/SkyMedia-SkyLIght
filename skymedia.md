sorry, but SkyMedia SkyLight 2025 is freeware but proprietary to me.
the executable here is an installer for the SkyMedia SkyLight 2025 web browser. 
even though the web browser is freeware, any extensios madeby SkyMedia corporation are not.
the text below is the product description.
SkyMedia SkyLight is a proprietary, free‑to‑use browser engineered for clarity, performance, and heritage. Inspired by the timeless design of Internet Explorer and the nostalgic spirit of AltaVista, SkyLight delivers a lineage‑faithful experience without the excesses of modern bloat.
- Precision UI — A sharp, professional interface with functional tabs, toolbar, and a dedicated “New Tab” button.
- AltaVista 2.0 Homepage — A branded gateway that evokes the early web while serving as a modern launchpad.
- Extension System (.skyext) — Inject CSS, run JavaScript, block hosts, or add context menus with such ease that even your grandma could do it if she was alive.
- Accessible Innovation — The extension format is so straightforward that even your grandmother could author one — and she might just surprise you with a custom ad‑blocker.
- Performance First — Lightweight, event‑driven architecture with no telemetry, no forced integration, and no unnecessary processes.
- Controlled Distribution — Free for all to use, but proprietary by design; the source remains on one device to preserve uniqueness and authenticity.
SkyLight is more than a browser — it is a professional program for those who value authenticity, precision, and a touch of wit in their digital tools.
